Bulls and Cows
--------------

First of all, the computer will generate a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the user tries to guess their computer's number. The user inputs a number and the computer responds with the number of matching digits. If the matching digits are in their **right** positions, they are "bulls", if in **different** positions, they are "cows".

For example, let's say the number is 2017.
A sample interaction might look like this:


```
Hi there!
I've generated a random 4 digit number for you.
Let's play a bulls and cows game.
Enter a number
>>> 1234
0 bulls, 2 cows
>>> 6147
1 bull, 1 cow
>>> 2417
3 bulls, 0 cows
>>> 2017
Correct, you've guessed the right number in 4 guesses!
That's {amazing, average, not so good, ...}
```

The program
-----------

The name of the complete program should be **bullsandcows.py**.
